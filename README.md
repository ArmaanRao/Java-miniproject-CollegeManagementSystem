Working of the College Management System
----------------------------------------------------------
There are three possible users, namely : 
admin, teacher, student.
The admin has the power to act as a teacher as well as a student,  
and ONLY the admin can add new login details to the login database. 

The teacher, can perform a plethora of operations such as :  
1)Adding new student details  
2)Updating old student details  
3)Viewing a students details  
4)Deleting a students details.  
  
Each operation does as the name suggests, and stores the inputted student details into the student database.  
The student user, can only view his/her details.  
The GUI aspect of this project, uses mainly frames, text-fields, labels, buttons, drop-down menu, pop up dialogs.  
If we try logging in as a non existing user,   
we get a pop-up dialog saying the user doesn't exist.  
If we enter a wrong password/username, we get an error message in the pop-up dialog.
